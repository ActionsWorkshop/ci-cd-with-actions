# Workflow 2: CD - Deploy to Dev-Test and Production environments

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25735209/112420062-8a2d6e80-8d52-11eb-9e04-1d20e8770d39.png)

In this workflow we will be focusing on creating a CD workflow. Continous deployment involves deploying to any hosted or on-premise production computes automatically. 

We will be using GitHub Pages hosted in two repos to illustrate the CD concepts. 
1. One of the repo will host a Dev-Test instance of our app.
2. The second repo will host the Production instance of the app.

These steps and Actions can be replaced with steps and Actions targeting any hosted or on-premise computes.

At the end of the exercise we will learn - 
1. Using environments in the workflow
2. Environment secrets and approvals
3. Using an Action from Marketplace
4. Environment variables at workflow level and at individual jobs level

## Deploy to Dev-Test environment

For Dev-Test environment, we will be using your fork of the `ci-cd-with-actions` repo to deploy to GitHub Pages. For example - `kanika1894/ci-cd-with-actions`

1. Create a new workflow file named `cd.yml` in `.github\workflows` folder. (You can also go to `Actions` tab -> `New workflow` and use `Skip this and set up a workflow yourself`, using which you will get a basic workflow template to fill in)
2. Add the name of the workflow as "React App CD"
3. Add triggers for the workflow as `Push` on `main` and `releases/*` branches
4. Next, we will add environment variables at workflow level, related to settings that are common for all instances where we want to deploy, so that these can be used by all the jobs in our workflow. The environement variables we want to define at workflow level are - `owner` and `domain` to construct the urls where our app will be deployed. 

Following is the yaml for the above steps. ðŸ’¡ Please replace the _owner_ in the snippet below as the user account or organization where the repo is. 
```yaml 
# CD workflow for React app

name: React App CD

on:
  push:
    branches:
    - main
    - releases/*

env:
  owner: <owner>
  domain: github.io
```
5. Add a new job with id `deploy-dev-test`
   - To run on `ubuntu-latest` 
   - Name the job as "Deploy to Dev-Test environment"
   - We will be specifying an environment named `Dev-Test` for this job and we will construct a `url` for this environment. This environment will be dynamically created by the Actions workflow during the first run. Refer to the yml snippet below for environment syntax.
   - We will define an environment variable at job level for the repository name where we will host the test instance of GitHub pages. Please note that we are defining it within Job scope as the dev-test repo hosting test instance is specific to this job. Refer to the yml snipped below for the environment variable syntax at Job scope.
   - Add the following steps to this job
      - Checkout the repository
      - Install and Build
      - Deploy to GitHub Pages by searching for an Action from Marketplace. 
         - We will be using `JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action`. This action will help in deploying the build folder we specify to a branch we mention.
   
   You can use the following yml snippet -

```yaml

jobs:
  deploy-dev-test:
    name: Deploy to Dev test environment
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: 
      name: DevTest
      url: https://${{ env.owner }}.${{ env.domain }}/${{ env.repo }}
    env:
      repo: ci-cd-with-actions
    steps:
      - name: Checkout 
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install and Build
        run: |
          npm install
          npm run build
      - name: Deploy 
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@4.1.5
        with:
          branch: gh-pages # The branch the action should deploy to.
          folder: build # The folder the action should deploy.
```
6. Commit the above yml workflow to `main` and observe the run in Actions tab. 

7. After the run has successfully completed, enable `GitHub Pages` settings to see your app deployed on Dev-Test environment.
   - Go to `Settings` in your repository and click on `Pages`
   - Please ensure that you have chosen `gh-pages` branch and `/(root)` folder. Press save. The settings should like below -

ðŸ’¡ If you don't find `gh-pages`, please check that the workflow has completed successfully and recheck here post run completion.

### Checkout deployed Environments!

On the repository's home page, on the right hand side you will find an `Environments` section listing down the environments. 

<img width="350" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58769601/134175027-0c02757e-b6bf-404d-b27a-56c8be863600.png">

Click on `Dev-Test` environment and `View deployment` ðŸŽ‰ You will find that your app has been deployed to the Dev-Test environment -

## Deploy to Production environment 

After the dev-test environment has been validated, we are ready to deploy to the next stage that is `Production`!
For production environment, we will create a new public repository to deploy to GitHub Pages, so that we have a separate production url where the app will be hosted.

### Create a new repository to used for production
Create a new public repository `actions-workshop-prod` in your user/organization account to be used for prod deployment.
   - Click on your profile icon on top right corner and open `Your repositories`
   - Press `New` to create a new repository
   - Provide the repo name as `actions-workshop-prod`
   - Ensure to choose `Public`
   - Leave rest options as default and click `Create repository`

### CD workflow changes
Lets go back to our `ci-cd-with-actions` repository to make changes to the CD workflow
   - Go to 'Your repositories' from your profile icon and open the `ci-cd-with-actions` repository

1. Production environments are generally governed by policies. So we will mimic that in our 'production' environment by adding protection rules specifically by configuraing approvals. Given that we are hosting the 'production' instance of GitHub pages in a different repository, we will configure the access token that will be required by Actions workflow to deploy. Think of this step as configuring credentials to your production compute where you intend to deploy. For adding an approval protection rule and to store the access token as a secret specific to this environment, we will configure a new Environment named `Production` in `ci-cd-with-actions` repository
   - Open `Settings` tab -> open `Environments`
   - Click on `New environment`
   - Give Name as `Production` and press `Configure environment`
   - Checkmark `Required reviewers` and add your username. Click `Save protection rules`
   - Under `Environment secrets`, click `Add secret`
   - Name your secret `TOKEN`
   - Add the PAT token generated for the scope 'public_repo' the the secret value and click on 'Add secret'. If you have not generated a PAT in the prerequisites, you can use the following steps.

<details>
        <summary><b>Click here for steps to generate PAT to access your public repositories</b></summary>
   - Click your profile icon on top right
   - Go to `Settings`
   - Now click on `Developer Settings` from the options listed on the left side
   - Inside Developer Settings, click on `Personal access tokens`
   - Press `Generate new token`
   - Check mark only `public_repo` scope.
   - Add a note in the text box provided and click `Generate token`

   Keep this tab open or copy the generated token to a safe place. This needs to used in the environment secret setting
</details>  

   This is how the environment setting should look -

2. Add a job to the CD workflow for deploying to the production environment
   Go to `ci-cd-with-actions` repo -> `Code` tab and open `.github/workflows/cd.yml` and edit it. Add a job to deploy to staging `deploy-production` 
   - Ensure that this job runs only after `deploy-dev-test` have completed using `needs`. 
   - Use the `Production` environment for this job.
   - Create a environment variable within the job scope to point to the repo where we will host the 'production' instance of GitHub pages.
   - In the steps 
      - Checkout the repo
      - Download the artifact we uploaded to GitHub Packges in CI workflow
      - Deploy to GitHub Pages for the 
        - `actions-workshop-prod` repository
        - `build` folder
        - `gh-pages` branch
        -  Provide `token` from `Environment secrets`
   
   Add the following job to the workflow file -
   
  ```yaml
  deploy-prod:
    name: Deploy to Production environment
    needs: [deploy-dev-test]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: Production
      url: https://${{ env.owner }}.${{ env.domain }}/${{ env.repo }}
    env:
      repo: actions-workshop-prod
    steps:
      - name: Checkout 
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install and Build
        run: |
          npm install
          npm run build
      - name: Deploy
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@4.1.5
        with: 
          branch: gh-pages
          folder: build
          token: ${{ secrets.TOKEN }}
          repository-name: ${{ env.owner }}/${{ env.repo }}
   ```
   Please commit the workflow to `main` branch.
   <Following is the complete workflow file content till now>
 
 ## See your Workflow in Action!! :tada:

After you commit the above workflow to `main`, go to the Actions tab to see the workflow run for `React App CD`. NOTE, since we configured approval for deploying to production environment, you will need to click on `Review deployments` and approve  for the workflow to run. Post successful deployment, you will be able to view the deployment urls in the run. Click on the production url to view the app deployed to production.

(Please check the GitHub pages setting in the `action-workshop-production` repository if you get 404 on the production environment)    
   
## Cleanup - Delete the PAT after the exercise

- Click on your profile icon -> `Settings` -> `Developer Settings` -> `Personal access tokens`
- Delete the Public_repo token created for this workflow.
